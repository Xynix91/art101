		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<p>
			The idea of this lab was to teach us about anonymous functions and callbacks.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			I experienced no major technical issues and my partner was solid with communication. However,
			my partner had difficulties handling the bonus task and getting the HTML manipulation to work
			in the JavaScript file.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			I created a JavaScript program that outputs an array mapped to two functions (one squaring
			and the other square rooting), one of which is explicitly defined while the other is anonymous.
			Both outputs are sent to the console.
		</p>	
		<div id="output"></div>
		<script>
			document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = results;
		</script>
