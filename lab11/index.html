		<h1>Lab 11: Libraries and jQuery</h1>
		<div id="challenge">
			<p>
				The idea of this lab was to teach us about jQuery, a JavaScript library, and its event handlers.

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				I had difficulties passing a function as the click event handler that did not depend on a variable
				outside its scope, since that variable would later be updated. I solved this by passing data to the
				event object.

		<div id="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				I created a JavaScript program that adds buttons to the three divs on this page and toggles the special
				class for them when their buttons are clicked.
