		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<p>
			The idea of this lab was to teach us about variables.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			I experienced no technical issues. However, my partner never responded to my Slack message
			and so I was forced to work alone. In addition, I had an accident that left me injured, hence
			my late turn-in.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			I created variables roughly describing a car without any sensible descriptors, including a
			make of "h", an invalid color, and an age of -979. Of course, I do not own this car.
