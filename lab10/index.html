		<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		<p>
			The idea of this lab was to teach us about JavaScript events and forms.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			I experienced no major technical issues aside from missing the event.preventDefault() line
			and my partner was solid with communication.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			I created a JavaScript program that took in an input form and sorted the name given when submitted.
		</p>	
		<form id="form">
			<input type="text" id="user-name">
			<button type="submit">Submit</button>
		</form>
		<div id="output"></div>
	</body>
