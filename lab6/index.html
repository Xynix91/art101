		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<img src="img/img.png"/>
		<p>
			The idea of this lab was to teach us about arrays and objects.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			I experienced no major technical issues. I had one small mishap where I thought JavaScript object
			keys would be indicated with strings as they are in Python, but I quickly solved that.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			I created an array indicating the two modes of transportation I use to get around campus:
			walking and the bus. I also made an object detailing the fictional car I described in Lab 5.
