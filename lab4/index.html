		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<p>
			The idea of this lab was to teach us how to write pseudocode. We practiced with an everyday task and a computer task.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			I experienced no technical issues. However, I had difficulties scheduling with my partner
			and we were forced to submit our documents separately.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			I created pseudocode for brushing my teeth in my dorms, which can be found in the lab report.
			I also created pseudocode for Merge Sort, which is found in this HTML file as well as lab.js.

		<h3>Pseudocoding an everyday task: Brushing my teeth in dorms</h3>
		<pre>
Grab my toothbrush, cup, and toothpaste in my room, and also grab my student ID card so I can get back in
Exit my dorm and head to the bathroom
If there is water on the counter, grab a paper towel
    Try to wipe it down. If it is not dry, grab another paper towel and repeat. Expect to use roughly six to eight paper towels on this.
Grab two paper towels and place them on the counter on top of each other
Place my toothbrush, cup, toothpaste, and card on the paper towels
Open the toothpaste tube and apply some toothpaste to the toothbrush. Close the toothpaste tube.
Grab another paper tower to be used to grab the faucet handle when needed.
Brush my teeth.
Brush my tongue.
Turn on the faucet using the designated paper towel.
Clean the toothpaste off the toothbrush.
Fill the cup.
Brush my tongue again with the rinsed toothbrush.
Clean the toothbrush again.
Turn off the faucet using the designated paper towel.
Rinse my mouth with the water in the cup.
Spit the water out.
Turn on the faucet using the designated paper towel.
Grab soap.
Wash my hands.
Rinse out the cup.
Turn off the faucet using the designated paper towel.
Wipe my hands off with more paper towels.
Grab the toothbrush, toothpaste, cup, and card with one hand.
Grab the three paper towels in use with my other hand.
Toss the paper towels out.
Grab one more paper towel to be used to touch the door handle to my room.
Exit the bathroom and head for my room.
Unlock the door using the ID card, making sure not to touch the door handle. Use the paper towel to punch in the code and open the door.
Once in the room, toss out the paper towel.
Put away the toothbrush, toothpaste, cup, and card.
Contemplate the safety of having a bathroom that is only cleaned once a week shared between an entire floor during the COVID-19 pandemic.

		<h3>Pseudocoding a computer task: Sorting a list</h3>

		<pre><code>
// This file is purely pseudocode detailing the Merge Sort algorithm.
//
// @author Hazel Prasetya
// @since  10/13/2021

// 1. Check if the list has a length of one.
	// a. If not, divide the list into two.
	// b. Repeat steps 1 and 1a for each individual list.
// 2. We should have many separate lists of length one that are sorted (since all lists of length one are sorted). Recombine the lists as they were divided using a merging algorithm.
	// a. Set a pointer at the beginning of each of the two lists.
	// b. Compare the values the pointers are pointing to.
		// i.  Add the smaller value to the completed list.
		// ii. Increment that pointer by one.
	// c. Repeat step 2b until a pointer exceeds the end of its list.
	// d. Add the remaining values of the other list to the completed list.
// 3. Repeat step 2 until we only have one list remaining.
